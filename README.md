# Turn VS code into one stop shop for ML experiments

In this project, we attempt to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset can be considered highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of the observations belonging to the positive class.
As the baseline, we train a Random Forest classifier and evaluate its performance using recall, precision and the F1 Score.
